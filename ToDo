ToDo:
- Switching Start and Select ingame
- every point in the settings menu with axis
- left Notices as "stack", what happens as last, e.g.
  6 stones broken <- small font
  + 2000 <- middle font
  5 stones broken <- small font
  + 1500 <- middle font
  DOUBLE! <- big font
- Noticed on the left, if you killed a stone on the other side, too
- new design for the modes without textures
- new background with prerenderd stars
- new game mode: reach points as fast as possible
- Arcade Mode
- new control (optional)
  - helping text (optional)
