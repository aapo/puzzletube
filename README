Important: You need to get sparrow3d
(git://github.com/theZiz/sparrow3d.git) to compile puzzletube!
If you got sparrow3d, type "make" to get the files needed by
puzzleztube. And it is necessary, that the puzzletube folder and the sparrow3d
folder are in the root directory, e.g.:
/home/username/stuff/sparrow3d
/home/username/stuff/puzzletube
especially the name "sparrow3d" is important, except you want to edit nearly
every *.h file of puzzletube ;-) alternatvely you can use some symlinks.
