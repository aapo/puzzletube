Important: You need to get sparrow3de 
(git://github.com/theZiz/sparrow3d.git) to compile puzzletube!
If you got sparrow3d, type "make testengine" to get the files needed by
puzzleztube. And it is necessary, that the puzzletube folder and the sparrow3d
folder are in the root directory, e.g.:
/home/username/stuff/sparrow3d
/home/username/stuff/puzzletube
especially the name "sparrow3d" is important, except you want to edit nearly
every *.h file oft puzzletube ;-)
